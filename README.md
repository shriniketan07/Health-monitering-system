# Health Monitoring System using ESP32, MAX30102, DHT22, and I2C LCD

**Overview**
This project aims to build a health monitoring system that reads vital health parameters such as BPM (Beats per Minute), 
SpO2 (Blood Oxygen Saturation), temperature, and humidity. The system uses the ESP32 as the central microcontroller, 
and various sensors are integrated for real-time monitoring.

**The sensors used are:**

 - MAX30102: For measuring BPM and SpO2.
 - DHT22: For measuring temperature and humidity.
 - I2C LCD: For displaying the data in a readable format.
 - The data is displayed on an I2C LCD, and it allows users to monitor their health in real time.

**Components Used**

 - ESP32 Dev Board: Main microcontroller for interfacing the sensors.
 - MAX30102: A sensor to measure heart rate (BPM) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2).
 - DHT22: A temperature and humidity sensor.
 - I2C LCD: To display real-time readings of health parameters.
 - Jumper Wires: For making connections between components.

**Features**

 - Displays BPM, SpO2, temperature, and humidity on an I2C LCD.
 - Real-time monitoring of health parameters.
 - Wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi) using ESP32 (optional feature for cloud connectivity).
 - Easy-to-use and compact design.
